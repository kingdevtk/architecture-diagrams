- ***Retool***: Retool helps developers build powerful internal tools, fast. Using their drag-and-drop components you can quickly create commonly-used internal applications like admin dashboards, database GUIs, and more, and then customize them to your company's needs using code. For this project, I was tasked with deploying Retool in a self-hosted environment on AWS. https://docs.retool.com/self-hosted

- **API: Beach Recommendations***: For this project, I was tasked with with designing a proposed backend infrastructure for a beach recommendation API.
         ***Requirements:
          - Users can get a list of beaches.
          - Users can get details about a beach. This includes a picture, the aggregate rating, and any comments.
          - Users can rate and comment on beaches.
          - The API application will be in a container and will receive traffic on ports 80 and 443.
          - The API will need access to a relational database
          - The infrastructure will need to handle massive user bursts during summer, and almost no users during winter.***
